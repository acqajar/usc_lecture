# Fall Course Outline - NoSQL

## Course Description
This course will examine 1-2 databases from each of the four main NoSQL data models (key-value, column family, document, and graph), highlighting the business needs that drive the development and use of each database. Finally, we will present criteria that decision makers should consider when choosing between relational and non-relational databases and techniques for selecting the NoSQL database that best addresses specific use cases.
